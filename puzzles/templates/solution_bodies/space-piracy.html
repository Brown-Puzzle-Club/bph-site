After inputting a number with a length of ten to fifteen and seeing some error messages about length being something like A or E, or after seeing a letter appear in the Result Overlap column, one (hopefully) realizes, in conjunction with the note on fingers in the flavor text, that the numbers inputted are being interpreted in hexadecimal, or base 16. This should prompt the solver to also check, and find, that the letters A, B, C, D, E, and F are all acceptable as part of an inputted number (though all other non-numeric characters are not).

This realization may occur before noticing the hexadecimal, but it should become clear that this is a black-box style guessing game. The number inputted has some relationship to a guess being made relative to the 12 rows in the table, and the *Result Overlap* column is displaying overlap of their guess with some hidden answers. The underlined orange section of each secret password is the overlap of the guess with the password, and any characters that are revealed are exact matches.

After inspecting some of the error messages that appear in the table with various guessed numbers and/or interpreting the "favorite functions" part of the flavor text, one realizes that the overlap is not the overlap of the secret numbers with the guessed number but rather the secret numbers' overlap with 12 distinct transformations of the inputted number. Errors (as opposed to warnings) occur when the transformation being applied fails to produce a valid result, and no overlap is shown. These error messages can be helpful in determining what the transformations are. The secret transformations are as follows:

1. Dividing by 2
2. Reversing the input
3. Multiplying by 3
4. Multiplying by 5
5. Adding 11...1 to the input, where the number added matches the length of the input; for instance, an input of 3F2 would have 111 added, resulting in 503
6. Dividing by 3
7. Subtracting 22...2, where length is matched as in transformation 5
8. "Peeling", where the first and last digit (or rather, hexit) are copied down and the process is repeated on the rest of the input; for instance, ABC123 would produce A3B2C1, where A3, B2, and C1 are iteratively "peeled" from the outside of the input
9. Dividing by 5
10. Subtracting the input from FF...F, where length is matched as in transformations 5 and 7
11. Squaring the input
12. "Cut and Swap": the input string is cut in half (with the left half containing the middle in the case of odd length), and these halves are swapped; for instance, ABCD123 results in 123ABCD

After realizing the various factors involved in the puzzle and determining the transformations involved, one can then find the inputs that overlap exactly with each password, which result in a green highlight in the table. The correct inputs, along with the overlapped passwords, are as follows:

1. A5C1C0DE  |  52E0E06F<br>
2. DEC15105  |  50151CED<br>
3. D1DAC1C5  |  27590454F<br>
4. 60DD55E5  |  1E452AD79<br>
5. F0CEFEED  |  101E00FFE<br>
6. AC1D1F1D  |  395F0A5F<br>
7. AB5CE5E5  |  893AC3C3<br>
8. DAABA5E5  |  D5AEA5BA<br>
9. 5AC1F1CE  |  1226C9F6<br>
10. B51C1DEA  |  4AE3E215<br>
11. A550C1AE  |  6AC13323EB47D400<br>
12. 6E0D51C5  |  51C56E0D<br>

After looking at the inputs for a moment, especially 1, 5, and 10 (though hopefully all), it should become clear that each input is the "hexspeak" encoding of some word or phrase, where A-F are simply those letters, 0 is an O, 1 is an I, 5 is an S, and 6 is a G. The passwords themselves are effectively random, as they are simply what results from transforming these hexspeak words and phrases with relatively arbitrary functions. Converting the inputs to pure letters results in the following:

1. ASCICODE<br>
2. DECISIOS<br>
3. DIDACICS<br>
4. GODDSSES<br>
5. FOCEFEED<br>
6. ACIDIFID<br>
7. ABSCESES<br>
8. DAABASES<br>
9. SACIFICE<br>
10. BSICIDEA<br>
11. ASSOCIAE<br>
12. GEODSICS

Each of these words or phrases is missing a single letter. The letters and the complete words/phrases are as follows:

I: ASCIICODE<br>
N: DECISIONS<br>
T: DIDACTICS<br>
E: GODDESSES<br>
R: FORCEFEED<br>
E: ACIDIFIED<br>
S: ABSCESSES<br>
T: DATABASES<br>
R: SACRIFICE<br>
A: BASICIDEA<br>
T: ASSOCIATE<br>
E: GEODESICS

Reading down the column of missing letters reveals <span class="spoiler">INTEREST RATE</span>, the final answer.
