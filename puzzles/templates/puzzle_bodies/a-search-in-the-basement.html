<div class="title"><b>1. Тетрис</b></div>

You're playing Tetris with your old buddies... unfortunately, your screen is in black and white! How many possible arrangements of pieces could have produced the observed screen?

<div class="title"><b>2. Exploring the Cosmos</b></div>

You are an orbit explorer! You begin on the orbit in the bottom right corner that circles each center. After this orbit, 
you only care about orbits that are completely contained in the diagram. You start moving along the orbit clockwise, and 
whenever you encounter a new orbit for the first_time, you switch to it. You'll reach a point where there's a tiny gap 
later on, and you find your spaceship can jump across it just fine. How many orbits do you partially explore before you start 
spinning in circles?

<div class="title"><b>5. The Fish!</b></div>

Every night, when you dream, you find yourself an intelligent cod fish that speaks with its
owner. While you usually have a varied diet, today you feel very picky, and you decide to
play a game to tell them what you want to eat.

<ol>
    <li>I do NOT want something that is alone in its own phylum.</li>
    <li>I do NOT want to eat anything that can fly.</li>
    <li>I do NOT want to eat anything that burrows into the ground.</li>
    <li>I do NOT want to eat anything that eats lots of jellyfish.</li>
    <li>My food should NOT have to scavenge to find its own shell.</li>
    <li>I do NOT want to eat things even resembling rodents OR spiders.</li>
    <li>There should NOT be a gesture with a name similar to my prey's name.</li>
    <li>I do NOT want my prey to be from the class with the most unique orders among what I usually eat.</li>
    <li>I do NOT want my prey to be from the same genus as another creature that I already eliminated.</li>
</ol>

I hope you give me the right prey! >:|
