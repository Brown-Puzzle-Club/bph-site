Seriously. Go find him. He knows the answer. He's on campus.

Oren too elusive? Select four of the following:

<ul>
    <li><b>Long-Distance Relationship</b>: Be an offsite-only team. Don't have anyone on campus for the remainder of the hunt.</li>
    <li><b>Selfie Time</b>: Have a team member take a selfie with someone whose name starts with O (include proof of this O name, such as a driver's license).</li>
    <li><b>Anger Management</b>: Submit photographic proof of a team member decapitating a stuffed bear.</li>
    <li><b>Enjoy The Weather</b>: Submit a picture of a team member wearing all black and sunglasses at a landmark recognizable by HQ, as a symbol of the worldwide influence of the Blueno Resurrection Society.</li>
    <li><b>Origin Story</b>: Did you know that Brown Puzzle Club was originally founded as the Bread People's Coalition? Submit a series of photos documenting a team member making “bread” from scratch. You should include the finished bread product.</li>
    <li><b>Portal to Providence</b>: Submit a video of a team member enjoying a meal containing at least two of the following three items: 
        <ul>
            <li>a donut (Providence has more donut shops per capita than any other metro area!)</li>
            <li>either coffee milk, Del's lemonade, or a Narragansett lager</li>
            <li>fresh seafood</li>
        </ul>
    <li><b>Time Travel</b>: Submit a 5-minute timelapse of one or more team members with a visible clock. Every thirty seconds, at least one team member must switch from a seated to a standing position. Every minute, a team member approach the camera and spin in a circle. During the final minute of the timelapse, all members should jump in the air in jubilation.</li>
    <li><b>Bear's Lair</b>: Film a high-quality nature documentary involving bears in their natural habitat. Bears only know how to eat, sleep, growl, and defend their territory. HQ is conducting a study on how Bears communicate mathematical concepts, so you should send us some observations that we can learn from.</li>
    <li><b>Open Curriculum</b>: Make a syllabus for the best course possible. Make sure that:
        <ul>
            <li>Nobody could ever fail the course (grading scheme must be outlined clearly)</li>
            <li>Each exam mentioned is generously curved in the most complicated way possible</li>
            <li>Semester-long outline of topics that will be covered in the course must be included (with diagrams where necessary)</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

Once you think you have finished four of the requirements above, please send a Contact HQ request providing shareable links to all the content expected. Once reviewed by our team (during our open hours), we will provide you with further instructions.
