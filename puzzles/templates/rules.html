            <li>This is a puzzlehunt! Teams of people will compete to solve puzzles (think escape room, not jigsaw) using information both online and in real life. 
              If you want to know more about what a puzzlehunt is, check out our <a href="#faqs">FAQ section</a>.</li>

        <ul>
            <li>This puzzlehunt is taking place at <strong>Brown University, in Providence, Rhode Island.</strong></li>
            <li>Kickoff will start promptly at <strong>Saturday, April 15, 2023 at 12:00 PM EDT</strong>, in <strong>MacMillan Hall Room 117</strong>, with doors opening at 11:30am.</li>

            <li>Puzzles will be released <strong>{{hunt_start}}</strong>. HQ will close at <strong>{{hunt_end}}</strong>, at which point hints will no longer be answered, the leaderboard will be frozen, and physical puzzles will no longer be available to be picked up.</li>
            <li>There may be <strong>in-person puzzles</strong>, which require physical presence on campus; <strong>physical puzzles</strong>, which require collecting objects from HQ; and <strong>events</strong>, which are not essential to finish, but will be a fun time anyway.</li>
            <li>Wrap-up will be on Zoom, at some point on Monday evening. We'll update this with more precise information closer to the date.</li>

      <h4 id="Goal">{% translate "What's the goal?" %}</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>The official winner will be the first team to find Blueno hidden somewhere on campus.</li>
        <li>Only teams which are on-campus during the final runaround will be able to find Blueno. Additionally, only teams with one or more current undergraduate/graduate Brown or RISD students on-campus are eligible to find Blueno. </li>
        <li>If you know that you will be on-campus and think that you might be in the position to find Blueno first, we highly encourage you to include a Brown University or RISD undergraduate/graduate student on your team. </li>

        <li>Brown Puzzlehunt is open to anyone, anywhere in the world, including those not in the Brown/RISD community. However, teams with current undergraduate or graduate students, or other members of the Brown/RISD community, may have some advantage in solving puzzles.</li>
        <li><b>We recommend teams to be around 5 to 8 people.</b> The maximum team size is 8 people. Students and those new to hunting are encouraged to build teams on the larger side.</li>

            <li>A few puzzles will be available at the start, and every puzzle you solve will unlock more.</li>
            <li>{% blocktranslate %}Each answer is a string of letters A&ndash;Z. Lowercase letters will be changed into uppercase, and any other characters will be stripped before checking for correctness.{% endblocktranslate %}</li>
            <li>You have <strong>{{max_guesses_per_puzzle}} total guesses</strong> for each puzzle. Contact us if you run out of guesses, and we would be happy to grant more. Random guessing and brute-forcing are discouraged.</li>

            <li>{% blocktranslate %}You can use a hint to get help on a puzzle. This can be something like a nudge in the right direction (i.e. you give us your progress on the puzzle and we&rsquo;ll try to get you unstuck) or an answer to a question (e.g. &ldquo;Which answers to these crossword clues are wrong?&rdquo;).{% endblocktranslate %}</li>

      <h4>{% translate "What is a puzzlehunt? How do I solve these puzzles?" %}</h4>
      <p>{% blocktranslate %}If you&rsquo;ve never heard of puzzlehunts before, here&rsquo;s a very brief summary: in a typical puzzle, you receive some information and have to extract an answer out of it, which is almost always an English word or phrase. Puzzles can come in many different forms; the only real commonality is that you usually receive no direct instructions, so it&rsquo;s up to you to figure out how to make sense of the information you&rsquo;re given. You can read a longer introduction to puzzlehunts <a href="https://blog.vero.site/post/puzzlehunts" target="_blank">here</a>.{% endblocktranslate %}</p>
      <p>{% blocktranslate %}If you are new to puzzles and are interested in seeing some examples, or if you&rsquo;re looking for some practice, we recommend looking at puzzles from other online hunts such as <a target="_blank" href="https://galacticpuzzlehunt.com/">Galactic Puzzle Hunt</a>, <a target="_blank" href ="https://teammatehunt.com/">Teammate Hunt</a>, or <a target="_blank" href="https://puzzlepotluck.com/">Puzzle Potluck</a>.{% endblocktranslate %}</p>

    <p>{% blocktranslate %}We are Brown Puzzle Club, a group of undergraduate students at Brown/RISD who are passionate about puzzles! Our goals for this hunt are to put a unique and fun experience on puzzlehunters' calendars, and to introduce more people in the Brown community to the joys of solving puzzles.{% endblocktranslate %}</p>

  <div class="no-break"> 
    <h4>{% translate "How hard will this hunt be? How long will it be?" %}</h4>
    <p>{% blocktranslate %}We've designed this hunt to be a relatively easy introduction to puzzlehunting for beginner teams, while also showcasing what makes puzzlehunts so fun.{% endblocktranslate %}</p>
    <p>{% blocktranslate %}There will be around 20 to 25 puzzles. Highly experienced, somewhat insane online-only teams may finish all online components in only a few hours, but we expect and encourage teams engaging with the on-campus puzzles to take longer. We expect this hunt to fill a similar niche to the <a href="http://www.baphl.org/">BAPHL</a> puzzlehunts.{% endblocktranslate %}</p>
