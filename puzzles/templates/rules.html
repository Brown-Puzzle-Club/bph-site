        <ul>
            <li>This is a puzzlehunt! Teams of people will compete to solve puzzles (think escape room, not jigsaw) using information both online and in real life. 
              If you want to know more about what a puzzlehunt is, check out our FAQ section.</li>

        <ul>
            <li>This puzzlehunt is taking place at <strong>Brown University, in Providence, Rhode Island.</strong></li>

            <li>Kickoff will start promptly at 12pm Saturday, April 15th, 
              in <strong>MacMillan Hall Room 117</strong>, with doors opening at 11:30am.

            {% format_time end_time "WEEKDATE_AT_TIME" as hunt_end %}
            <li>Puzzles will be released <strong>{{hunt_start}}</strong>. HQ will close at 7pm Sunday, April 16th, at which point hints will be answered at a slower rate and physical puzzles will no longer be available to be picked up.</li>
            <li>There may be <strong>in-person puzzles</strong>, which require physical presence on campus; <strong>physical puzzles</strong>, which require collecting objects from HQ; and <strong>events</strong>, which are not essential to finish, but will be a fun time anyway.</li>
            <li>Wrap-up will be ***at some point on Monday***</li>
        </ul>

    <div class="no-break">
      <h4 id="Goal">{% translate "What's the goal?" %}</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>The official winner will be the first team to find Blueno hidden somewhere on campus.</li>
        <li>For obvious reasons, only teams which are on-campus during the final runaround will be able to find Blueno. Additionally, only teams with one or more current undergraduate or graduate students on-campus are eligible to find Blueno. </li>
        <li>If you know that you will be on-campus and think that you might be in the position to find Blueno first, we highly encourage you to include a Brown University undergraduate or graduate student on your team. </li>

    <div class="no-break">
      <h4 id="Participation">{% translate "Who can participate?" %}</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Brown Puzzlehunt is open to anyone, anywhere in the world, including those not in the Brown community. However, teams with current undergraduate or graduate students, or other members of the Brown community, may have some advantage in solving puzzles.</li>
        <li>We recommend teams to be around 5 to 8 people. Teams of students are encouraged to be on the larger side. Experienced or highly dedicated teams may want to be smaller (5 or less people). The maximum team size is 8 people.</li>

        <h4 id="Solving">{% translate "How do puzzles work?" %}</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>All puzzles will be visible on the website; this is where you will submit your answers and receive new puzzles. If something in real life is part of a puzzle, the website will direct you towards it first.</li>
            <li>A few puzzles will be available at the start, and the primary way to unlock new puzzles is by solving puzzles and progressing through the hunt.</li>
            <li>{% blocktranslate %}Each answer is a string of letters A&ndash;Z. Lowercase letters will be changed into uppercase, and any other characters will be stripped before checking for correctness.{% endblocktranslate %}</li>
            <li>You have <strong>{{max_guesses_per_puzzle}} total guesses</strong> for each puzzle. If you legitimately run out of guesses and need more, feel free to contact us, though we won’t grant your request if we see that you were, for example, guessing random thematic answers, or brute-forcing all 10-letter words.</li>

            <li>If you are a beginner student team or a team with a strong on-site presence that is not in the running to win, we will also visit you frequently to check that you’re having fun and to give tailored hints to help you along. Having fun is the most important thing! If you want someone on HQ to come and visit you, you can email us at any time; but we will also drop in as often as we can.</li>
            <li>{% blocktranslate %}You can use a hint to get help on a puzzle. This can be something like a nudge in the right direction (i.e. you give us your progress on the puzzle and we&rsquo;ll try to get you unstuck) or an answer to a question (e.g. &ldquo;Which answers to these crossword clues are wrong?&rdquo;).{% endblocktranslate %}</li>

      <h4>{% translate "What is a puzzlehunt? How do I solve these puzzles?" %}</h4>
      <p>{% blocktranslate %}If you&rsquo;ve never heard of puzzlehunts before, here&rsquo;s a very brief summary: in a typical puzzle, you receive some information and have to extract an answer out of it, which is almost always an English word or phrase. Puzzles can come in many different forms; the only real commonality is that you usually receive no direct instructions, so it&rsquo;s up to you to figure out how to make sense of the information you&rsquo;re given. You can read a longer introduction to puzzlehunts <a href="https://blog.vero.site/post/puzzlehunts" target="_blank">here</a>.{% endblocktranslate %}</p>
      <p>{% blocktranslate %}If you are new to puzzles and are interested in seeing some examples, or if you&rsquo;re looking for some practice, we recommend looking at puzzles from other online hunts such as <a target="_blank" href="https://galacticpuzzlehunt.com/">Galactic Puzzle Hunt</a>, <a target="_blank" href ="https://teammatehunt.com/">Teammate Hunt</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://puzzlepotluck.com/">Puzzle Potluck</a>, or <a target="_blank" href="https://reddothunt.sg/2018">REDDOThunt</a>.{% endblocktranslate %}</p>
